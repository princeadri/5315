      <h2>1What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>GIT is a source code management system that tracks the content or codes during the development cycle. We need source code Version Control System to manage the history of changes made to a file or set of files. Instead of creating multiple versions of the same file under an almost identical name, a version control system allows the user to mark those changes by putting a ‘tag’, so the user can revisit that change in the future. In addition, the user may also revert back to the content of the document from its older version.

      <h2>2. Term definition</h2>
      <p>There are two types of GIT repositories (repo): local repo and remote repo. A local repository is on the user’s local computer for direct use, while a remote repository is a version of the project that is hosted elsewhere and typically for indirect use. For team projects GIT is useful for collaboration because it allows multiple developers to work simultaneously on the same project while ensuring that there are no code conflicts between those developers. It is open-source and  allows for the visibility and traceability of work.
